<title>Cellery - the nefarious vegetable</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Background</h1>
<p>In 1948 UFOs invaded Earth The aliens look much like humans but can be distinguished by their facial expression when they eat cellery. The aliens enjoy the taste while real humans tend to dispose of the vegetable in the nearest trash can.</p>
<p>It is unknown why the aliens try to make humans eat cellery but the most popular theory is that they are evil and want to slowly starve humans to death by forcing them to eat nothing except cellery.<p>
<h1>The plan</h1>
<p>It is believed that the aliens need the cellery because the cheweing motion is how they breathe. Without cellery they suffocate. The plan is to destroy all cellery and thereby thwart the invaders.</p>
<h1>After the silent battle</h1>
<p>The fields formerly used to grow cellery will be reseeded with cocoa plants so we can get more chocolate, which is a natural alien-repellant</p>
