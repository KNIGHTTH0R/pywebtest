s1: simple occurence test

s2: simple multioccurence test (suitable for order-ignorant algorithms like bm25)

s3: simple proximity and word-order test


Suggested tests:
	s1:
		"tomato" should yield exactly f1, f3, f5
		"cucumber" should yield exactly f4, f5
		orange+cucumber should yield f5 as top result
	

	s2:
		"wheat" should yield f1, f2, f3. Order is interesting.
	
	s3:
		Giraffe+skateboard should yield 7 results, roughly in 1..7 order. although f1 might be detected as spam or trivial
